# Command Line Interface (CLI) Commands

## `ls` Command
The `ls` command is used to list files and directories in the current working directory. You can use different flags to modify the output, such as `ls -l` to show detailed information including file permissions, sizes, and modification dates.

## `cat` Command
The `cat` command is used to concatenate and display the content of files. You can use it to view the contents of a file directly in the terminal. For example, `cat filename.txt` will display the content of `filename.txt`.
